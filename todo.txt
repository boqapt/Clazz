change superConstruct* to superclass.construct[.direct/.apply]

write tests for:
- result of inherit for 4 combinations of base/clazz being function/object
- result of inherit for 8 combinations of base/clazz being function/object and next class in chain being function/object
- presense of correct superclass
- prototype of function base left unchanged
- prototype of function clazz changed if not autoConstruct in cases of base function/object
- constructor called if autoConstruct
- in chain of inheritance with length 4 .superclass always points to parent's table of methods
- in chain of inheritance with length 4 superConstruct* is present for each link
- check table of methods for: value overriden method in parent is parent's, for not overriden same as in child
- custom extendFunc
